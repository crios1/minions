# Contributing to Minions

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **Minions**.

Minions is early-stage, opinionated, and evolving quickly. Contributions are welcome, but the bar for acceptance is correctness, simplicity, and alignment with the project’s core goals.

## Scope

Good candidates for contributions:

* Bug fixes
* Documentation improvements
* Small, well-scoped enhancements
* Performance or correctness improvements

For larger changes, new features, or architectural ideas, **please open an issue first** to discuss direction before writing code.

## Design Philosophy

Minions prioritizes:

* Simplicity over abstraction
* Clear lifecycle and ownership of state
* Async-native, single-process systems
* Practical correctness over theoretical completeness

If a change adds complexity without clear benefit, it is unlikely to be accepted.

## Code Expectations

* Keep changes focused and minimal
* Follow existing patterns and structure
* Avoid over-engineering
* Tests (where applicable) should pass

There is no strict style guide beyond consistency with the existing codebase.

## Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a focused branch
3. Open a PR with a clear explanation of *what* and *why*

PRs may be declined if they don’t align with the project’s direction. This isn’t personal — Minions is intentionally curated.

## Questions

If you’re unsure whether a contribution makes sense, opening an issue to ask is always welcome.

Thanks for taking the time to contribute.
