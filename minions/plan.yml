ResourcedPipelines:
- update gru.py
  - start_minion
  - stop_minion
- add tests / check for regressions
- add same __init_subclass__ check on pipelines? so that logic should be extracted to AsyncService?
  yes it should because i want to make sure that any domain object can't set private attrs
  but then i wouldn't be able to do that in my own subclasses
  so i should just have methods and in that the method
  so i can extract the logic to like AsyncService._ensure_no_new_priv_attrs
  and then just call in the domain objects __init_subclass_ selectively
