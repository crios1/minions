Situations:
- compose domain obj file (py)
  ... but then how do i verify composition? -> run w/ gru
      but if i run w/ gru then i'm checking for if it accepts
      or runs successfully.
      ... i can check rejects w/ the error returned by gru method
          i can check runs successfully with a good helper method.
